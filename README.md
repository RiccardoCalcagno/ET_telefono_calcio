# E.T. Telefono Calcio

![E.T. Telefono Calcio](Resources/ProjectImage.png)

**E.T. Telefono Calcio** is a mixed reality educational game developed in Unity, designed to serve as a hands-on learning experience in immersive technology courses. In this game, the user remotely controls a flying saucer using hand gestures to strike a soccer ball and score goals in a virtual goalpost placed in the real-world environment.

This repository includes a **comprehensive step-by-step tutorial** that guides students through building the entire project‚Äîfrom object placement and interaction to scripting, physics, and gesture-based control.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By completing this project, the students will be introduced to:

- The basign compontes of the Unity Editor UI and its core functionality.
- Designing and configuring complex prefabs (goal, ball, spaceship)
- Implementing **spatial audio** adn **particle effects** for immersive feedback
- A collection of building blocks provided by the **Meta Interaction SDK** including:
   - Camera Rig
   - Passthorugh
   - Grab Interaction
- A cheap gesture-based control algoritm for tracking expressive hand gestures
- Advanced **physics and collision handling** using `Rigidbody`, `Collider`(use of **Unity's Layer Collision Matrix** and Physic Materials)
- Component-based scripting using `MonoBehaviour`, coroutines, and object interactions
